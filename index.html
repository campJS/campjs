              CampJS creates a unique blend of expert-led, structured content
              and self-directed, unstructured learning. Some content is
              scheduled, but the main area is reserved for hacking. The final
              night is reserved for demos for people to show off what they have
              built or learned at the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              CampJS IV will commence at 3pm Friday on the 31st of October, and
              run through to 9am Monday the 3rd of November. The Camp will be held at <a

            <p>
              The venue provides food, drink and comfortable accommodation for
              the duration of the event. You may camp on the grounds if that is
              your wish.

              <p>
                WebGL is a powerful graphics API built into most modern desktop/mobile browsers
                which can be used for a variety of graphics intensive applications such as
                cartography, image processing, graphing, medical/scientific visualisation,
                2D/3D games and even general purpose parallel-computing.
              </p>
              <p>
                This workshop will cover the basics of WebGL development from the ground up.
                Starting from shader programming, students will learn how to use the WebGL API
                to create interactive, high performance graphical web applications. Lessons
                follow the nodeschool.io convention of short, guided exercises with interactive
                feedback. A number of expert WebGL developers will be in attendance to guide
                and assist.

            <h1><a name="learn-libuv" href="#learn-libuv">learn libuv</a></h1>
            <h3>Thorsten Lorenz</h3>

              <p><a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">libuv</a> is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It was primarily developed for use by Node.js, but it's also used by Mozilla's Rust language, Luvit, Julia, pyuv, and others.</p>

              <p>
              libuv is the interface to the underlying system, providing an
              API to perform asynchronous file system operations, access TCP
              or UDP sockets, IPC, listen to file system events and more.
              Additionally it provides an event-loop implementation backed
              by kernel eventing mechanisms like epoll and kqueue.
              </p>

              <p><strong>
                It is no overstatement to call libuv the powerhouse of
                Node.js</strong> and thus it is important to understand it
              in order to understand how Node.js works.  The best way to get
              a better understanding is to use libuv as a library in C
              programs.
              </p>

              <p>
              This libuv workshop will have you do exactly that. You'll be
              reading files, download webpages and other fun stuff and all
              that via simple C programs.
              </p>

              <p>
              After completing the workshop you should have a much better
              understanding of libuv and thus the inner workings of Node.js
              and be equipped to troubleshoot any problems you may run into
              in the future in a more educated manner.

            <h3>Tam McKenzie</h3>

            <p>
            Design best practices are founded in the psychological study of how the human mind perceives and retains information. Humans have very real limitations when it comes to attention, memory, sight and ability to process logic. These limitations affect the way we need to design interfaces and application response times.
            </p>

            <p>
            By understanding these underling principals a system designer is empowered to create better user experiences that are fun, responsive and connecting.

                that can be used to bring CommonJS into the browser; and advanced use cases for
                these modules, such as sharing code between the client and the server, swapping

              Duo was built to replace <a href="https://github.com/component/component">Component</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
              Duo makes the manifest optional, bundles only the JS and CSS that you need, has built-in github versioning and support for source transforms.
              The goal of Duo is to blend the very best ideas of the Component and Browserify package managers with inspiration coming from Golang.
              </p>
              <p>
              This workshop will get you up and running with Duo. You will learn how Duo scales from single one off-scripts, to building isolated components, to powering your entire front-end application.
              </p>

              <p>
              I hope by the end of this workshop you will not only know how to use Duo better but also gain insights into organizing and distributing large client-side applications.

              <p>
              Changes in the way you structure your code, and how you approach certain problems, can have a huge impact on your application's performance.
              Identifying problems and resolving them can be tricky, luckily there is a plethora of tools for the browser and the server to assist you.
              In this talk we will cover some basics on how to identify, assess, and resolve performance issues, and give you some knowledge and tools to allow you to do the same in both your browser and server side code.

              Maurice has a passion for, and deep understanding of, JavaScript and the web in general, however his CSS skills have been likened to drawing with crayons…
              He is heavily involved in the JavaScript and Brisbane development community, is an organiser of the BrisJS meetup, helps out where he can with Node Bots and regularly speaks at meetups and conferences.
              He is currently working on large full stack Node.js applications, targeting global payments at scale.

              Kory has been writing JavaScript applications for over five one hundredths of a century and has developed a strong opinion for un-opinionated code. He usually pursues the unattainable goal of ‘solving’ UI’s, but has an interest in the whole stack to down to hardware.

              <p>
              It can sometimes be difficult to switch gears between software
              languages. It can be even more difficult to find help during the
              process. Andrew Eddie recently found this while making a cold shift
              from PHP to Node and in this talk will share some of his journey
              towards becoming productive and proficient again. He'll look at the
              basic syntax differences, how to cope with scoping differences in an
              asynchronous environment, how to adjust object-oriented architectural
              patterns (like "where did my namespaces go?"), and tool equivalents
              for application building, testing and documentation.

              This talk is suited for any competency level as well as anyone

                It's Node-compatible and ships with Wifi built in.

                I assume you have some tests for your JS packages - you are using packages
                right?  You are?  Good, testing for browser environments? Great - well let's
                talk about how some of those tools you think have your back, really don't and
                what you need to do to up your game. In this workshop session, I'll talk about
                how to set up a real testing environment for modern browsers, testing modern
                browser APIs (including WebRTC) and why some of the tools you are using no
                longer represent reality or are just plain hard work.

                node-webkit combines Node.js and Chromium engine so you can
                call all Node.js modules directly from DOM. It enables a new
                way of writing applications with all Web technologies. This
                session is an introduction to the node-webkit project,
                including key features, use cases and project history. In the
                workshop, there is lab for the key features so you can practice
                it with Roger.
