    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <p>
    You should have received an email containing a link to a spreadsheet.
    Please use this to indicate whether you need transport to or from CampJS
    so we can help make sure everyone is looked after. Carpool where possible!
    </p>
    <h3>Getting to CampJS IV</h3>
    <p>
    Free busses will get you to and from the CampJS venue. Busses will leave
    the airport around 2pm, then swing by Varsity Lakes Train station shortly
    thereafter. If you want to be picked up from Varsity Lakes, be there by
    2pm.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pickup point at Gold Coast Airport will be outside the International
    Arrivals side of the airport, as marked on the map below. Note
    that Gold Coast Airport is tiny, you should not have trouble finding us.
    For early arrivals – people will be waiting at the pub.

    <h2>Things To Bring</h2>

    <h4>Earplugs</h4>
    <p>
    I expect there to be noise late into night, and I can't guarantee people
    won't snore. If you want to sleep well, bring earplugs. I cannot stress
    this enough.
    </p>
    <p>
    I personally sleep with earplugs every night and it is bliss for me and
    convenient for others who can get on with their lives without worrying
    about disturbing me. If you don't bring earplugs, I don't want to hear
    you complaining about noise.
    </p>
    <h4>Warm Clothes</h4>
    <p>
    e.g. Jackets, Scarves, gloves, onesies. It can be pretty cold at night time.
    </p>

    <h4>Sleeping Bag + Pillow</h4>
    <p>
    It's going to be rather cool weather. I recommend bringing a sleeping
    bag. Maybe pack an extra blanket just in case. If you cannot bring such
    items please <a href="mailto:timo@campjs.com?Subject=Need%bedding"
      target="_top">let me know</a> and we will sort something out for you.
    </p>

    <h4>Bathroom</h4>
    <p>
    The usual – toothbrush, shampoo, soap, talisman of purification, deodorant, etc.
    </p>

    <h4>Additional Drinks</h4>
    <p>
    Unlimited beer, red/white wine, a margarita machine, juice, coffee, tea
    and soft-drink is provided courtesy of CampJS. You're welcome to bring
    harder liquors if you so desire.
    </p>
    <h4>Snacks to Share</h4>
    <p>
    Please bring a little something and donate it to the snack pile.
    </p>
    <h4>Computer, Phone &amp; Associated Chargers</h4>
    <p>
    Power boards and cables will be available but it helps if people bring bring more. Please label them so we don't accidentally steal them.
    </p>
    <h4>Headphones</h4>
    <p>
    Music will be provided for the main hall, but if you
    want to listen to something different, please do so from the comfort of
    your own headphones.
    </p>
    <h4>Instruments</h4>
    <p>
    Bring 'em. Even noisy ones.
    </p>
    <h4>Medications</h4>
    <p>Let's stay healthy.</p>

    <h4>Warm Clothes &amp; Earplugs</h4>
    <p>Reminder: bring warm clothes and earplugs.</p>

    <h4>Tools for coping with no Internet</h4>
    <p>
    Plan to have zero internet. Don't plan to have even a little. Zero.
    </p>
